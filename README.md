# GITHUB REPOSITORY PAGE CLONE

This is a personal project I took on to develop my CSS skills. Throughout the project, I faced some couple of challenges, one of which was implementing the dark mode but I did it and learnt so many new techniques :smile: .

Knowledge of flex box and grid was very important for the layout of elements and text-blocks.

I used a desktop-first approach for this one and making the entire layout responsive for mobile displays was quite easy :grinning: .

## Getting the icons and avatar

For beginners seeing this, all I did was use the built-in inspect element tool in chrome to grab the codes.
